		<p class="text-center">This site has only 1 dev who is also the owner, creator, and an australian high school student.</p>
		<p class="text-center">This site originally started as a fork of 3kh0 but only some games were taken, I coded all of the menus.</p>

	     <p class="text-center">Hello, I'm just here to say two things. First off whoever suggested "sorry to clog helpdesks but ur awesome for this I dont need nothing just spreading dat positivity Keep it up" Thank you so much man, you are why I do this.
		 And secondly, whoever suggested this: "who are you and what other games do you have I know you made astral-games.onrender.com so thank you" I did NOT make astral games, that is a very good site that is much better than my coding abilities so ig thank you
		 for saying I'm good enough to do that? This is not a team of devs or anything I'm just one guy who is really not that good at coding HTML. Also if you are suggesting such a thing, why not add your email? There's now a section for anyone who has a question to
		 give me their email so I can properly give an answer.</p>

	     <p class="text-center">Hello users, sorry for not working on my site in a while, I really don't have an excuse. I just wanted to come here to thank you for playing my games site (Seriously this is such a great experience and I'm so glad I actually get players)
		 (I also make tons of money as a bit of a plus) and also to clear up some confusion I've seen through the game suggestion box. First off there is already a search bar. Secondly I can't add regular Minecraft or Fortnite so 1v1.lol and eaglercraft are the best 
		 you'll get. Thirdly I can't add Roblox or a Proxy, other sites has done them but idk how to add roblox and I can't add a proxy without entirely changing how my site is ran. And finally, I will not be selling my site or doing any collaborations with other sites.
		 Now that the obvious bits are done, I just wanted to say thank you for all the nice notes I get as well as the more personal stuff people talk about. It makes it feel more like I'm actually doing stuff that's worth my time rather than just adding games for 
		 mindless school children to play. Somebody fairly recently told me they knew I was in Anchorage, which I'm not, but this made me think I should actually give some context as to who I am to the 100 monthly users who check this page. I am the solo dev of games-site
		 yes it is only me, just one 15-year-old Australian boy who stole games from 3kh0 and added them to his own github page so he could play them with friends. Overtime I worked more and more on this site until early last year I found out I was actually getting players.
		 Since then my player count has grown tremendously and I am so thankful for that. A lot of my games selection was stolen from 3kh0 and in my suggestions, some other games site owner said he was gonna take games from my repo so we've really come full circle.
		 Someone else in the suggestions gave a long and passionate reasoning for why I should add skibidi toilet tower defence. Also a lot of people who suggest games don't really know that the retro and flash games pages exist because I always get suggestions for
		 games like sonic, run 3 and Tetris. Sometimes I get the odd suggestion from someone in my school and it's always funny when they use my real name. There's also the opposite, people from other schools who think someone at their school made this site so they
		 use an inside joke or a name that I don't know the meaning of. I also get many suggestions where random people send me their email in them and idk I think that's kinda funny. But that's about all I have to say, thank you for reading and for playing my site.</p>

	     <p class="text-center">Hello everyone, pretty soon you'll start to see ads on a couple of the pages of this site. These ads will only show on the "All Games" page and the "Flash Games" page. The Retro Games page won't run ads for legal reasons. There won't be 
		 any ads while you're playing your games because I know how annoying that is, if a game does have ads, it wasn't me who put them there it was the developer of the game. With the addition of ads I will be able to work on this site much more often as it will be
		 worth my time. This means more games, quicker responses to suggestions and quicker updates to games. Thank you to everyone who will continue to use my site, I know how annoying ads can be, but just realise this benefits both you and I. Thank you and goodbye.</p>

	     <p class="text-center">Hello users of my site. I've got a new update about the future of my site. First off, in my first update I said that I didn't know how to add a search bar to my site but now I've finally found a good tutorial and my new search
		  bar works! There's now search bars on all the games pages, they're located just beneath the sorting buttons. Secondly, I've added 2 of the most requested games. The #1 most requested game was 1v1.lol / fortnite with it having 21 total requests 
		  (16 for 1v1.lol and 5 for Fortnite), Since it is nearly impossible to add fortnite I've just clumped 1v1.lol in with fortnite. Then I also added the #3 most requested game which was Minecraft with 5 people suggesting it. It's of course illegal and near 
		  impossible to add current Minecraft to my site so I just added Minecraft Classic. The #2 most requested game was easily Roblox with 18 people qrequesting it but I have no idea how I would even be able to do that but apparently some other games sites have it. 
		  I've ran analytics for a week so far and it has shown that I that I get a lot of users per week and if I'm gonna continue updating this site for the thousands of you out there it needs to be something worth doing and adding ads is my way of giving 
		  you guys the best possible games site which only comes at the cost of the slight inconvenience that is ads. Thank you for everyone who continues to use my site and support me I really appreciate it.</p>

     <p class="text-center">Hello, sorry for going entirely dark for the past few months, my school banned this site so I stopped working on it, I had no idea that this site blew up. I initially made this website just as a little fun for me and my friends when 
	 we get bored in class but now I see that so many people have started using it too. Today I looked up my site and went to check the feedback and I had 172 suggesitons! Weirdly they started coming in the same month I stopped work on this site.
	 Judging by these replies there is a lot of work that could be done on this site which I will now start updating. To make this site worth my time I may put up ads but only on the main pages so that I don't disrupt any gaming.
	 According to some of the feedback, there's apparently another games website called "gamesforsite" which I have never heard of and apparently they said my site is lame, it was never meant to be anything big just some fun for me and my friends.
	 I'm also thinking of starting a discord server to make things easier and so I can connect with you guys but I don't actually know how many active users I get so I am setting up analytics to check that before I go any further.
	 And lastly I would just like to thank everyone who uses this site even if I didn't know they existed! As for everyone who gave feedback, I will try my best to implement all of it but I don't make any promises as of now.</p>

	 	 <p class="text-center">also to everyone who asks about a search bar, I have no idea how to add one so just use ctrl+f for now, I suprisingly don't know much HTML</p>
		 <p class="text-center">oh and also no, I cannot add roblox.</p>
